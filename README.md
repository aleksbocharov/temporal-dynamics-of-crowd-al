# TEMPORAL DYNAMICS MODEL FOR THE AGGRESSION LEVEL OF VICTIMS IN FLOOD EVACUATION CENTRE
Dealing with people who have survived natural disasters, such as floods is always a challenge for volunteers, especially when the number of victims is high. Their emotional state of the victims is often unstable and therefore controlling them becomes a difficult task. In this paper we explain our idea of modeling individualsâ€™ aggression levels in evacuation centers for floods (or any other natural disasters) victims. We will discuss how we developed and evaluated a formal model that in perspective can be used as a base for building an intelligent agent or other type of software that can be helpful in training volunteers to handle the aggressive behavior of victims better there-fore enhancing the effectiveness of their work thus improving environment in evacuation centers.
